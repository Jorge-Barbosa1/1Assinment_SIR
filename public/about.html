        <p>Hello, my name is Jorge Barbosa, I am a Computer Engineering student at IPVC. </p>
        <p>As part of the Sistemas de Informação em Rede course (Sir), I created this WebAPP</p>
        <p>This application was created with the aim of managing a list of students, where it is possible to add, edit and remove students.</p>
        <p>In addition, a REST API was created to manage student data.</p>
